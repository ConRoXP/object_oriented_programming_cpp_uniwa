# Object Oriented Programming w/ C++  
A brief showcase of the curriculum:  

• Principles and mechanisms of object-oriented analysis and software design.  
• Overview of object-oriented programming in the C++ language.  
• Basics of C++, differences with C.  
• Organization and compilation of C++ programs.  
• Definition of new types. Abstraction in data.  
• Classes I (build - destroy functions, copy construction, inline functions, overloading).  
• Namespaces, Inheritance.  
• Classes II (virtual and fully virtual functions, abstract classes).  
• Function templates and class templates.  
• The C++ Standard Template Library (STL).  
• Input / Output in C++.  
• Exception handling.  

**Lab**: The lab more or less dictated whether a student would pass this course or not.  
In this repository I will upload all the potential exam topics I coded in preparation for the final exam.  
For the purposes of this course, we were allowed to use `using namespace std;`.
